# Welcome to DASC Lab

Research is hard. This is a quick-start guide to get you started. On the left, there are some basic skills that we hope will help you understand what it takes to do research. 

Once you've gone through this, you might feel that you need some starter problems to understand the vast literature that is out there, and then to help you figure out where you might be able to make some contributions. For this, we have what are essentially a set of worksheets that guide you through finding papers, reading them critically, reviewing them, and recreating them.

Please help contribute to this document - it will help you, and your future labmates.
